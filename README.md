## Setup
Run the following commands to install necessary dependencies.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/concepts-ai/concepts
```

## Train & evaluation
Please see the individual READMEs. 

## Demo
Coming soon!

## Warning
LEFT leverages a pre-trained large language model as its language interpreter, and hence, even though our prompts are general examples of first-order logic, we do not have direct control over the LLM's generation. The LLM may output harmful biase.

## Setup
Run the following commands to install necessary dependencies.

Install [Jacinle](https://github.com/vacancy/Jacinle).
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/vacancy/Jacinle --recursive
  export PATH=<path_to_jacinle>/bin:$PATH
```

Install Concepts
```
  pip install git+https://github.com/concepts-ai/concepts
```

## Demo
Please check out this [demo notebook](starter-simple-shapes.ipynb), to see how to apply LEFT on a new dataset in ~100 lines of code! 

## Train & evaluation
Please see the individual READMEs. 

## Warning
LEFT leverages a pre-trained large language model as its language interpreter, and hence, even though our prompts are general examples of first-order logic, we do not have direct control over the LLM's generation. The LLM may output harmful biases.
